# Without -A/--auth, initdb defaults to using "trust" authentication. In other
# words, anyone can connect (locally via unix sockets and remotely via TCP).
# The assumption there is that the admin will immediately configure user
# authentication. Since we can't do that, and having a wide-open SQL server
# running is suboptimal, we default to rejecting all connections until the
# user explicitly sets this up
